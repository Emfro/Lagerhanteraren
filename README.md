# Lagerhanteraren
##Axel Boström & Emil Fröjd
##Introduction
This is a Storagehandler, which is essentially a database of products, each of these having certain specific elements chosen by the user. The actions available are the following:
- Add product
- Remove product
- Edit product
- Undo the last change
- Print the database
- Quit

##Build
This program is built by means of a makefile. To compile and run one must simply write "make run". To compile and run separately, one must simply write "make lagermain", and then "./lager" to run the program. 

##Usage
The program is used by following the guidelines given during runtime, using the acceptable input given to the user. 

##Goals
During the development of this program, we have not been able to achieve any goals using the code written, as we achieved most of these during previous projects.

##Expansions
If we were to expand on this program, we would probably make the "Undo" function reusable, that is, if used mutiple times, multiple choices would be undone.
